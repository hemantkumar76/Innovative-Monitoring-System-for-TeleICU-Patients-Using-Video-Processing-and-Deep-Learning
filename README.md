## Description
The ICU Monitoring System is designed to help healthcare professionals remotely monitor ICU patients, reducing the burden on on-site intensivists. The system includes:

- People Detection Model: Identifies various people in the ICU Room (nurse, intensivist, family member, patient).
- Movement Detection Model: Detects patient movement to alert healthcare professionals.
